### Requires Java 7 or above https://www.java.com/ES/download/ ###  
Download Link: https://github.com/Koupah/Among-Us-Editor/releases  
Download the .jar file by clicking on it, then run it once it's finished downloading  
From there, it's as simple as choosing your settings then applying & running the game  
  
NOTE: You need to relaunch/have your game closed when using this! 
The game only seems to read settings on launch, so use this then launch your game!

## Secret/Glitched Color (Fortegreen) ##
The secret color is a lighter version of the dark green, in lobbies chat normally won't work, you can't customize your character. People also see your name as "???".  
In game, your dead body will be red, in meetings you'll be red and in chat you'll be red.
Therefore there can be 3 greens and 2 reds, and I believe if multiple people have a different color value above 12, there can be multiple glitched greens (Untested).

## Information for those interested: ##  

Custom names that include "\\", ")" or "\[" will result in a "Banned from Room" message and you also cannot include "," in your name as it breaks the file.  
Names longer than 10 characters will also not work in online games, local play lets you make a lobby but I'm not sure if others can join.
