InvisibleName|True=Invisible name only works with local games and not anymore with online games\nYou can join the discord server for updates on when I make a workaround!

ResizableGUI|True=Resizable GUI is ridiculously buggy.\nI highly suggest not using it



AUEVersion=1.0-1.58
Controls|Index:1=Control settings (Mouse/Mouse+Keyboard) might be inverted in versions below 1.58\nThis is because Among Us updated which one was the default\nIf you didn't change this setting you don't need to worry about this message.

//This will always exist because I'm never getting to version 10.0 lol
//Basically everything below here is stuff I always want to warn for
AUEVersion=1.0-10.0

Color|12=Using the Fortegreen color can cause the following:\n-Hats not showing\n-Skins not showing\n-Pets not showing\n-Black Screens when hosting\n-Incorrect spawn location\n-Not being able to talk in lobby chat\n\nYou can find all the issues listed on the GitHub page!

KillCooldown|0=Using 0 Kill Cooldown causes issues,\nUse a number like 0.01 or even a negative number like -1 instead.
VotingTime|0=If you set Voting Time to 0, it actually sets it to be infinite!\nUse 1 second instead if you want the shortest vote time possible!
